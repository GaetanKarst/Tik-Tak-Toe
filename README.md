# Tik-Tak-Toe
Description:

As I wanted to get more familiar with the .NET framework, I decided to make a very simple Tik-Tak-Toe WPF Program.
I choose to make a WPF program over a Window Form App because this format offers the possibility to be more creative in the layout thanks to the XAML mark-up language, which was pretty easy to catch. 
The overall goal was to sharpen my knowledge of C# and especially without Unity being a framework offering a lot of features making developers' life easier.
